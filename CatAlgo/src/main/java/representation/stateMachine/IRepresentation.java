/**
 * <p>
 * A <b> representation </b> is an information structure that determines which categories are 
 * being perceived in a given context (a context is a set of objects), and which relations bind them together. 
 * For a subject, to develop a representation of a given context consists in the building of a structured 
 * and tailor-made category network. This will allow him to : <br>
 * -abstract the context, i.e. access to general categories that summarize what is true about any object 
 * to which they apply. <br>
 * -find paths in this network to access properties and goals on objects as efficiently as possible. <br>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> 
 * A representation of a context is constructed out of a set of object's descriptions (one for every object 
 * in the context), provided by a "context input" ( {@link IContextInput} ). <br>
 * Among several equivalent description formats (see {@link IDescription}), an object can be described by a 
 * relational description ( {@link IRelationalDescription} ) ; so can be a category. A relational description 
 * associated with an object <i> o </i> is characterized by a set of orders <i> O </i>. Each order <i> p âˆˆ  O </i> 
 * denotes a <i> property </i> of this object or category. If an      
 * The contextually relevant 
 * categories that can be used for the description of a given context can be found by the following procedure. are to be found in the Galois lattice 
 * <i> Gal(O,P,M) </i>, where : <br>
 * -<i> O </i> is the set of objects <br>
 * -<i> P </i> is the set of <i> pairs of attributes </i> formed by the union of the binary relations contained 
 * in every relational description of an object. <br>
 * -<i> M </i> is the mapping of <i> O </i> in <i> P </i>. <br>
 * Every element in this lattice, except for its minimum, is a category that can be described in terms of its 
 * <i> intent </i> (i.e. its meaning, expressed by a binary relation) or in terms of its <i> extent </i> (the 
 * subset of objects to which it applies). The lattice's atoms are categories whose extent includes a single object, 
 * so they can be assimilated to this object. <br>
 * The lattice provides an inclusion order over the set of categories such as, <i> A </i> and <i> B </i> being two 
 * categories, <i> B </i> is a sub-category of <i> A </i> if <i> A </i>'s intent is a subset of <i> B </i>'s, or 
 * (equivalently) if <i> B </i>'s extent is a subset of <i> A </i>'s. <br>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An important element of this lattice is its maximum, called the <i> signified </i>. It is the most general category, 
 * the one that applies to every object in the context and tells what is true about all of them. It is named so because 
 * it emerges from the grouping of the set of objects that constitutes the context, as if it were "coded" by this context, 
 * which would then act as the signified's <i> signifier </i> (following Saussure's terminology). <br>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> 
 * Each representation can be verbalized following a descriptive program or <i> algorithmic description </i>. 
 * This program will first describe the signified, and then specify which additional information must be brought 
 * to it in order to obtain its relevant sub-categories. By going down the network this way, from categories to 
 * their sub-categories, one finally reach the objects of the context (which are the smallest categories, 
 * whose extent only contains themselves). <br>
 * An <i> algorithmic description </i> can then be defined as a sub-machine of the representational machine, in
 * the flow chart of which a single path can be found from the signified to any object in the context (the different 
 * paths in the flow chart can of course have common sections, which makes the description all the more efficient). The 
 * "single path constraint" is consistent with the way we verbally describe a context : a multi-path description would 
 * yield something like "this is a big blue ball, and also something blue that is big and that is a ball, and also..." <br>
 * Many algorithmic descriptions of a single representation can usually be generated. But they are assigned a cost, 
 * which is a measure of the amount of information they use ; this way, one description amongst all possible ones 
 * can be designed as the most efficient and as such, as the preferential description of the representation (see 
 * {@link IAlgorithmicDescription}). <br> 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to take into account all previous considerations about relations, it is proposed here to implement them as 
 * states machines ( {@link IRepresentation} ), with the following properties : <br>
 * -The representational machine is a finite state automaton (FSA), with the special feature that each 
 * one of its state is a contextually relevant category. Categories being themselves implemented as
 * finite state automata ( {@link ICategory} ), this makes the representational machine a <i> 
 * meta-machine </i>. <br>
 * -A transition exists in the representational machine between a state <i> A </i> and a 
 * state <i> B </i> iff <i> A </i> is a super-category of <i> B </i>. <br>
 * -As in any FSA, the transition function takes as input a state and a symbol, and returns a state. 
 * But this time the symbol is not an arbitrary element from a predetermined alphabet. It is a tailor-made 
 * operator which, by attributing values to dimensions an declaring new dimensions inside 
 * these values, is indeed a procedure that transforms one "category" machine into another (dimensions 
 * being <i> interface states </i>, acting as place holders in the categorical machine ; and values 
 * being states or "sub-machines" implementing these interfaces). <br>

	 * A transition function contains the rules governing the transition between states while the machine 
	 * evaluates of a word, and successively reads its symbols. It associates an input consisting in a 
	 * given state and a given symbol, to an output state. <br>
	 * 
	 * Instead of being needed as an argument to the constructor of the state machine as it would usually 
	 * be expected, the transition function of a representational state machine must be inferred from the 
	 * comparison of its "category" states. The reason is that this machine doesn't use a predetermined 
	 * alphabet of symbols to determine its transitions. Instead, this alphabet is a set of tailor-made 
	 * operators, containing the procedure by which the state machine of the input category can be 
	 * expanded and transformed into the machine of its sub- (or output) category.
	 * 
	 * To facilitate the construction of the transition function, {@link ICategory} has a method that takes 
	 * another category as an argument, and returns a transition rule ( {@link ITransition} ) if the specified
